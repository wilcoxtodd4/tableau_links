This was just a fun project to experiment with creating custom shapes for a visual.

The district tournament, despite having 7 teams, seems to always come down to Sherwood vs McMinnville.
While the district does have several strong players from the other 5 schools, the key matches to determine the championship usually come down to the matches between these teams.

This visual contains two elements of note:
  1)  The ease of viewing the tournament in the context of these two teams.  Their matchups and results are easy to find without scanning through two large, text-heavy draw sheets.
  2)  Results of the individual matches can be seen by hovering over each spot in the draw.  So, no information is actually lost by the conversion to the visual representation.
