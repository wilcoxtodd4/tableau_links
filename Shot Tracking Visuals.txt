This viz is a small subset of a larger statistical and visual analysis I did for two players I coach.

By selecting the stroke type using the Stroke filter you can see the contact point and spot the ball lands for each shot of that type hit.
For shot types with too much noise, sample groups 1-5 can be selected to reduce the shots included.

The biggest insight from this is related to Backhands hit by Player 1.  They had good consistency with 82% of backhands in play, but very few were directed cross-court.
  This is especially notable since Player 2 struggled with their backhand, only making 62% of their shots.


Methodology:
  -- Shot tracking data was gathered using the SwingVision app (iOS only) - exported as a csv.
  -- Data cleansing and further shot classifications were done using SAS Studio, then exported to Excel as an input for Tableau.
